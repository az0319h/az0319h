In contrast, <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">web development</strong> fascinated me because the output was reflected on the screen as soon as I wrote the code. This led me to broaden my understanding of the web through <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">clone coding</strong> and various learning resources. Later, while exploring how <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">backend</strong> data could be integrated into the frontend, I joined a <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">full-stack bootcamp</strong>, where I gained systematic knowledge of how the frontend and backend are structured and interact through several <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">team projects</strong>. During this process, I experienced the role of a <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">full-stack developer</strong> who can handle all areas, but I eventually realized that the field I excel in and truly enjoy is <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">frontend development</strong>. This is why I decided to apply as a <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">frontend developer</strong>."

While writing efficient and well-structured code is important, I believe the most critical aspect lies in the interface users interact with and the <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">user experiences</strong> they have throughout that process. Based on this perspective, I have always focused on designing <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">user-centered</strong> screens and <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">interactions</strong>. In particular, I often took the lead in <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">frontend roles</strong> during <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">team projects</strong>, driving <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">UI/UX decisions</strong>, and consistently received positive <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">feedback</strong> about my contributions in <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">peer reviews</strong>.

Whenever I encountered challenges or had questions during the <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">learning process</strong>, I immediately organized them and sought <strong className=\"text-primary-blue-200\">advice</strong> from experienced developers to deepen my understanding.
